# TouchSomeGrass
An Orbital 2023 Project by Coco Li and Ang Yuki.

Team Name: TouchSomeGrass

### Proposed Level of Achievement
Apollo 11 

## Project scope
A mental health mobile application that allows the user to journal, meditate, and discuss with others in a gamified environment to cultivate good mental health habits.

At the home page of the application, users will see the available features represented as icons at the bottom, as well as a graphic of a tree that represents their progress in terms of improving and tracking their mental health. When the user accesses the journaling and meditation functions of the application, they gain experience points that contribute to the growth of their tree.


## Problem motivation
When you have exams, assignments, and projects all due, it can be difficult to take care of your mental health, reflect and manage the stress of studying for everything, which is when your wellbeing may take a backseat.

However, support for mental health improvement is not always accessible. After all, meditation does not come easily to everyone, and it may be difficult to remember to journal and self reflect daily. Moreover, most people do not have access to appropriate platforms that are specialised for discussing their mental health. 

Given that mental health is such an important aspect of a person’s overall well-being, we have decided to create a one-stop application with various features to make mental health management much more accessible to individuals.
 

## Proposed Core Features
A mental health mobile application that allows the user to journal, meditate, and discuss with others in a gamified environment to cultivate good mental health habits.

This application will have 4 key features.

Firstly, the journaling function allows users to pen down anything that comes to their mind, especially when they are feeling overwhelmed. This feature provides them with an opportunity to articulate their state of mind at any moment by simply accessing the function within the application on their smartphone. Journaling is a healthy coping strategy that instils mindfulness and helps individuals gain insight regarding their mental health.

Additionally, there will be a guided meditation feature that allows users to have moments of mindfulness amid their busy lives. Meditation has the ability to provide a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit a person’s emotional well-being. Accessing the function allows the user to pull up a video with a 10 minute countdown, where the user can meditate for 10 minutes while listening to the soothing sounds of nature.

Furthermore, having a supportive community is able to provide users with a sense of belonging and offers a feeling of purpose to individuals in the community. Through the community engagement forum on the application known as the “The Healing Circle”, users are able to support each other in their mental health journey by giving advice, encouragement or simply being a listening ear to others.

The last feature is the gamification of the user’s progress. In the home page of the application, there will be a tree that represents the amount of progress the user has made in their mental health journey. Every time the user accesses the journaling and guided meditation functions, the tree will grow a little, allowing the user to see how they have progressed.
