# TouchSomeGrass
Coco and Yuki's Orbital 2023 Project

Team Name: TouchSomeGrass

Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11 

Motivation: 

When you have exams, assignments, and projects all due, it can be difficult to take care of your mental health, reflect and manage the stress of studying for everything, which is when your wellbeing may take a backseat. However, mental health is as important as physical health and it must not be neglected regardless of how hectic our lives are.

Even if you do want to improve your mental health, it can be hard to know where and how to start. Support for mental health improvement is not always accessible. After all, meditation does not come easily to everyone, and it may be difficult to remember to journal and self reflect daily. Moreover, most people do not discuss their mental health, so where should you go to achieve these goals?

Aim:

This application will guide users in the daily management of their mental health and make their mental health journey smooth and simple. The application aims to help users develop good habits of taking care of their mental health for better mental wellness in the long run.
